### Health Insurance Charges [Linear Regression]

In this project, I have tried to understand Linear Regressions by trying to predict charges of a customer given certain parameters such as age, bmi, smoker, region etc.
The notebook contains in detail my approach to 
1)	Data Preparation
2)	Exploratory Data Analysis
3)	Correlation
4)	Linear Regression using a single Feature
5)	Linear Regression using multiple Features
6)	Models for both
7)	Calculating RMSE
8)	Creating a training and test dataset.
